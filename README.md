## Learning Path Generator (Agentic Workflow)

Generate a comprehensive, structured learning path for any topic with curated resources and realistic timelines.

### Core Concept

Multi-Agent Learning Curriculum Designer that creates progressive learning paths with real-world resources.

- Input any learning topic or skill request
- AI agents collaborate to research, curate, and structure resources
- Generate phase-based curriculum with clear milestones
- Include diverse resource types (courses, tutorials, projects, documentation)
- Provide realistic time estimates and skill progression tracking

### Implementation Flow

1. **Topic analysis and research planning**
  - Parse the learning request and identify key subtopics
  - Plan research strategy for comprehensive coverage

2. **Resource discovery (Web Search Tool)**
  - Search for courses, tutorials, books, and documentation
  - Find beginner to advanced resources
  - Research prerequisite skills and knowledge
  - Look for hands-on projects and exercises
  - Identify popular learning platforms and their offerings

3. **Content evaluation and filtering**
  - Analyze the resources found for quality indicators
  - Check for recency and relevance
  - Identify free vs paid resources
  - Note estimated time commitments

4. **Curriculum structure design**
  - Organize resources into logical learning sequence
  - Define learning milestones and checkpoints
  - Balance theory with practical application
  - Plan project-based learning components

5. **Learning path generation**
  - Create structured curriculum document
  - Include resource links, descriptions, and time estimates
  - Add progress tracking mechanisms
  - Generate study schedules and deadlines

6. **Self-reflection and optimization**
  - Review the generated path for gaps and redundancies
  - Ensure logical progression from basics to advanced
  - Refine based on coherence and completeness

### Tech Stack

- **AI/ML**: OpenAI GPT models with Langfuse integration for tracking
